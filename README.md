## 🎯 About Me

I'm a machine learning enthusiast with practical experience in AI model validation, GenAI service deployment, and full-stack content tools. I’ve worked with Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI, and Payload CMS to improve AI workflows and infrastructure.  

I enjoy solving real-world problems through automation, code, and cross-functional collaboration — and I’m continuously exploring the intersection of AI, DevOps, and scalable systems.
